All updates to the config files should be made in this repository, then use the helper scripts to sync them with your local machine:

## Vim/Neovim

Go [here](./docs/vim.md) to find the Vim-specific documentation.

## Git

If this is your first time running this script:

`chmod +x ./scripts/sync_git.sh`

then

`./scripts/sync_git.sh`

_These scripts are confirmed to be working on Mac only, but most Linux distros should work as well. Sorry to any Windows users ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_
